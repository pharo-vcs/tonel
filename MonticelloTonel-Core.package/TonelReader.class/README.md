I'm a monticello reader for tonel format repositories. I read
- a package per directory
- a class per file
- a set of extensions to a single class per file (for example, all extensions of a package to String will be in a single file)

I'm created on a file reference to a directory where the package will be read and the name of the package to read.

```
TonelReader on: 'someDirectoryWithTonelPackages' asFileReference fileName: 'MyPackageName'
```

My main method is
- `#definitions` reads and parses the tonel file, returns a list of monticello definitions.
- `#snapshot` returns a monticello snapshot with the read definitions.
- `#version` returns a monticello version with the read snapshot.

! Implementation details

The monticello versions I return do have artificial information. Since I'm just meant to read versions from a directory, this directory has no information such as commit message, commit time, author, or ancestors. Check the method `#loadVersionInfo` for more information.
